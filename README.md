# Nicotine+

Nicotine+ is a graphical client for the SoulSeek peer-to-peer system. It is an attempt to keep [Nicotine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150720173459/http://nicotine.thegraveyard.org/) working with the latest libraries, kill bugs, keep current with the SoulSeek protocol, and add some new features that users want and/or need.
